# Projekt Brzoskwinia

This website is dedicated to showcasing my songs -- because Soundcloud was just too limiting. So back in 2018 I wrote my own mini-app for playing and presenting my creations.

Everything is made by me from scratch in **PHP** and vanilla **JS**. No frameworks used back then.

In a near future (hopefully) a new version of this whole thing will be made, powered by Vue and Nuxt.
